### 4. NFT Collections Achieve Higher Beta to ETH, Indicating Amplified Returns
- **What's New:** Certain Ethereum NFT collections like Moonbirds, Mooncats, and CypherBrokers have significantly outperformed ETH’s rally, showing a high "ETH beta" meaning they amplify price movements compared to ETH itself.
